Frontend Framework: Next.js is now explicitly defined as the primary framework for the extension UI
Component Library: Added shadcn/ui as a separate component library (previously it was combined with Tailwind)
Styling: Tailwind CSS is clearly defined for utility-first styling
State Management: Jotai is now firmly included (removed the "if needed" qualifier)
Database: Added Vercel Neon as the PostgreSQL serverless database solution for storing user preferences and potentially saved subtitles


Everytime create a extension folder to load and test in chrome, pleae add suffix "-v" + number in ascending order, lets say now i alr have extionsion-v1, next one create extionsion-v2
